A bot that can detect can detect soil quality,  can send data on the website, perform autonomous mapping and can be controlled over the internet.

  - Detection of Soil Quality: Utilizing moisture sensors and possibly other sensors to assess soil quality parameters such as pH, nutrient levels, temperature, etc.

  - Collection of Samples: Incorporating a spiral mechanism for sample collection and a rotating box to store the samples securely.

  - GPS-based Navigation: Implementing GPS technology for navigation and mapping purposes, allowing the rover to navigate autonomously within a predefined area.

  - Autonomous Missions: Designing the rover to perform autonomous missions using a microcontroller, various sensors, and possibly IoT connectivity for remote monitoring and control.

  - Data Streaming through IoT: Sending data collected by sensors in real-time through IoT connectivity, enabling remote access and analysis of soil quality data.

  - Control Over Internet: Allowing remote control and monitoring of the rover's operations via the internet, possibly through a web interface or dedicated software application.

  - Data Mapping: Creating maps or visual representations based on the data collected by the rover to facilitate easy interpretation of soil quality characteristics.

  - Integration of Solar Panels: Adding solar panels to the rover to improve battery backup and extend operational time, ensuring longer missions without the need for frequent recharging.

In addition to the listed points, we might also consider some features such as robustness, durability, and adaptability to various terrains and environmental conditions. Furthermore, ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and security is crucial, especially when transmitting sensitive information over the internet.
